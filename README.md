====================
This was a project to make an inspirational quotes site. 
This was from week 2 of my developer bootcamp.
Lee Asher - www.github.com/rleeasher collaborated on the project.
Features include making new quotes, deleting quotes (with confirmation), rating quotes, and sorting quotes by author or rating.
